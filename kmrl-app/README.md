# 🚇 Metro Link - Intelligent Document Management System

![Metro Link Workflow](kmrl-app/assets/Workflow.png)

## Overview

**Metro Link** is an enterprise-grade intelligent document management system designed for railway operations, specifically built for Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL). The system revolutionizes how railway organizations handle vast repositories of technical documents, maintenance records, and operational data through AI-powered processing, multilingual content handling, and intelligent information retrieval.

**Problem Solved**: Railway operations generate thousands of technical drawings, maintenance reports, incident records, and financial documents scattered across multiple systems. Metro Link provides intelligent document processing, multilingual OCR (including Malayalam), and AI-powered search capabilities to transform unstructured data into actionable insights.
